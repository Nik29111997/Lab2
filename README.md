# Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) ML Models

This repository contains two machine learning models for the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

## Model 1: Random Forest

- File: `Nikhil_model_v1.ipynb`
- Algorithm: Random Forest
- Description: This model uses a Random Forest classifier to predict whether a breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign based on various features. Accuracy scored 0.96.

## Model 2: Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

- File: `Nikhil_model_v2.ipynb`
- Algorithm: Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Description: This model uses a Support Vector Classifier to predict whether a breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign based on various features. Accuracy scored 0.95.

## Overall

Both the models seems to work fine due to the high accuracy. However, Random Forest has higher accuracy which makes it a better model.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
